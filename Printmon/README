Original purpose of this script was to monitor a directory and batch print any
 text files that were dropped into it.  The user wanted it packaged as an .exe
 and was going to install it as a service on a windows box.  That is why I set
 it up as a permanent 'while loop' - it will run indefinitely until the 
service is stopped.

Right now there is no argument passing for changing the directory or specifying
what printer is used... 

Directory is a variable at the beginning of the script...

Printer is configured to grab the default printer...
